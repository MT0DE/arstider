# Arstider
This is mainly a test run with my HTML and CSS to see how it worked on a actuall website. 
Nothing interesting was made. Just a simple test on some CSS attributes which seemed intriuging

Haven't made anything on GitHub before and this is my first try. If anything could be enhance or
made differently, if you don't mind, leave me a message and i will try to improve it some day. 

The word "arstider" is actually written with one of the 3 special leather which can be found in 
Norwegian and Swedish, "Ã…rstider" means "Seasons" in english.
